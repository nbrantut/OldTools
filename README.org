* OldTools.jl

A simple module with useful functions or shorthands that do not exist in base julia, that I use all the time and would require loading unnecessarily big modules (with lots of precompliation time!).

None of these codes are suppposed to be versatile and generic, they just work for common input types (arrays of Float64 mostly).
